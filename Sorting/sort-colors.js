/*
Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of 
the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
